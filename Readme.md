# DAO Smart Contract

## Vision

The **DAO** smart contract enables decentralized governance and decision-making through voting on proposals. This contract also manages a treasury that releases funds based on the outcome of community votes, providing transparency and fairness in fund allocation.

## Features

- **Cast Vote**:
  - Users can vote on proposals, with the votes recorded and tallied to reflect community decisions.
- **Release Treasury Funds**:
  - Treasury funds are released only if the proposal receives more "yes" votes than "no" votes, ensuring the community approves fund allocations.

## Future Scope

1. **Weighted Voting**:

   - Implement a weighted voting system where votes are proportional to the stake or contribution of the user.

2. **Proposal Submission**:

   - Allow community members to submit new proposals for voting, further decentralizing governance.

3. **Automated Fund Distribution**:
   - Introduce automated fund distribution based on successful proposal execution, reducing the need for manual transactions.

The **DAO** smart contract creates a transparent and decentralized governance system, allowing users to participate in decision-making and fund management in a secure, trustless environment.
